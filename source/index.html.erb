  <h2>What is this thing?</h2>
  <p>
    It's a lightly-structured party where people get together and work on a project in a new programming language, either with or just near each other.
  </p>

  <p>
    This all started with the realization that plenty of people have a side-project in mind to work on, that it's more fun to work together, and that many of us are just waiting for a good excuse to get started.
